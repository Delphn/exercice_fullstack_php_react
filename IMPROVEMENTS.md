## Some improvements that could be made to the project

### 1. Architecture
  - Containerizing the project with docker to make it easier to run, maintain and deploy
  - Implement comprehensive error handling and logging to diagnose issues and improve the stability of the application

### 2. Frontend
  - Add TypeScript to the project to improve the type safety and make it easier to maintain
  - Add more style to the project to make it look more appealing and user-friendly
  - Add a loading state with a spinner to indicate to the user that the API request is in progress
  - Add animations during the selection of an answer, highlighting of the correct answer, and transitions between questions
  - Add support for saving the quiz progress (local storage or session storage) so users can pick up where they left off in case they leave the page
  - Make the page responsive and optimized to support mobile devices and tablets
  - Add support for keyboard navigation, so users can navigate through question and answers using the keyboard instead of mouse clicks

### 3. Backend
  -  Implement better HTTP error handling to display appropriate error messages to the user if the API request fails
  -  Implement a better way to handle the API credentials (e.g. environment variables, secure key management system, etc.)
  -  Implement caching to reduce the number of API requests and improve the performance of the application
  -  Implement rate limiting to prevent the application from being abused and to prevent the API from being overwhelmed
  -  Implement a leaderboard or a way to save and compare high scores, to incentivize users to complete the quiz multiple times and challenge themselves and others

### 4. General
  - Add tests to the project to ensure the code is working as expected and to facilitate easier maintenance in the future
  - Add documentation to the project to make it easier for other developers to understand and contribute to
  - Add internationalization support to make the quiz accessible to a wider audience
  - Make the app more accessible to users with disabilities (e.g. colorblindness, low vision, etc.)
